# Testing the Gravity Bridge Portal

With the upcoming deployment of the Gravity bridge module on the Cosmos Hub, we will finally be able to transfer assets between Ethereum and Cosmos. We at blockscape wanted to celebrate this cosmic milestone by contributing something to the user experience â€” behold, the Gravity Bridge Portal.

Please follow this medium article: https://blockscape-network.medium.com/how-to-use-the-gravity-bridge-portal-ad24887b230e

Here is the link for the Gravity Bridge Portal (Please set Metamask to Goerli Test Network):

For Bug Tickets I have created a Repository:

The Portal is in development process and is continuously updated.
