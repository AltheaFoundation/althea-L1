/**
 * @title Liquid Infrastructure NFT
 * @author Christian Borst <christian@althea.systems>
 *
 * @dev An NFT contract used to control a Liquid Infrastructure Account - a Cosmos Bank module account intrinsically connected to the EVM
 * through Althea's x/microtx module.
 *
 * A Liquid Infrastructure Account typically represents some form of infrastructure involved in an Althea pay-per-forward network
 * which frequently receives payments from peers on the network for performing an automated service (e.g. providing internet).
 * Each instance of this LiquidInfrastructureNFT contract represents one x/bank module account, the address of which is a part of
 * the ERC1155 URI.
 *
 * As the x/microtx module is used to conduct microtransactions (the payment layer for Althea networks), receiving accounts
 * will accrue Cosmos Coins and likely spend these same tokens to pay their upstream costs. If any such account is a Liquid
 * account (see x/microtx documentation), the x/microtx module will query this LiquidInfrastructureNFT's BalanceThresholds
 * values to determine how much of which tokens to leave in the x/bank account. All excess amounts will be converted
 * from Cosmos Coins to ERC20s and deposited here. The owner of the Liquid Account may later withdraw the balances
 * this NFT holds via the withdrawBalances() function.
 *
 * Occassionally devices and wallets can be lost, in which case the owner of this contract can call recoverAccount()
 * to begin a recovery process which will finish after the transaction completes. Asynchronously the x/microtx module
 * will ignore thresholds and transfer all of the Liquid Account's balances to this NFT, which may be withdrawn
 * normally with withdrawBalances().
